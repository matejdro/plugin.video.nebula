# This addon is unmantained at the moment. I switched to [Matt's plugin](https://www.matthuisman.nz/2021/01/nebula-kodi-add-on.html) which is much more complete and feature-rich.

Kodi plugin that allows playback of videos from [Nebula streaming service](https://watchnebula.com/).

To use this plugin you MUST have a valid Nebula subscription. This extension is UNOFFICIAL and not affiliated with Nebula in any way.

# Installation

1. Select Download ZIP option on the github (usually green button in the top right corner)
2. Save that zip to any location that Kodi can access
3. In Kodi go to System -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file
4. Select the ZIP file that you just downloaded
5. Open addon settings and enter your username and password for Nebula
6. Enjoy

Feel free to open any issues on the github with any problems or suggestions.

# Development

To set up development environment, you have to set up python virtual environment and install all requirements. While these are not required for the plugin's functionality, it enables autocomplete in IDE, easing development:

```
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
